            Evaluation by the Guide
            
            The guide/supervisor shall monitor the progress being carried out by the project groups on a
            regular basis. In case it is found that progress is unsatisfactory it shall be reported to the
            Department Evaluation Committee for necessary action. The presence of each student in the group
            and their involvement in all stages of execution of the project shall be ensured by the guide.
            Project evaluation by the guide: 30 Marks. This mark shall be awarded to the students in his/her
            group by considering the following aspects:
            Topic Selection: innovativeness, social relevance etc. (2)
            Problem definition: Identification of the social, environmental and ethical issues of the project
            problem. (2)
            Purpose and need of the project: Detailed and extensive explanation of the purpose and need of
            the project. (3)
            Project Objectives: All objectives of the proposed work are well defined; Steps to be followed to
            solve the defined problem are clearly specified. (2)
            Project Scheduling & Distribution of Work among Team members: Detailed and extensive
            Scheduling with timelines provided for each phase of project. Work breakdown structure well
            defined. (3)
            Literature survey: Outstanding investigation in all aspects. (4)
            Student’s Diary/ Daily Log: The main purpose of writing daily diary is to cultivate the habit of
            documenting and to encourage the students to search for details. It develops the students’ thought
            process and reasoning abilities. The students should record in the daily/weekly activity diary the
            day to day account of the observations, impressions, information gathered and suggestions given,
            if any. It should contain the sketches & drawings related to the observations made by the students.
            The daily/weekly activity diary shall be signed after every day/week by the guide. (7)
            Individual Contribution: The contribution of each student at various stages. (7)</p>
